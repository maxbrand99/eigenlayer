	"description": "0xak & Maxbrand99 run node services across multiple chains and products, and have a track record of working with quality projects and maintaining high uptime. We are one of the 10 standard validators for Ronin, maintaining a delegated stake of over $33 million from Ronin users who trust us with 99.99% uptime. We have maintained both the chain and bridge for Ronin (post-hack!) over ~11 months, securing the chain's $232 million TVL and $1B+ in natively issued tokens. We were invited to run, and currently do run a node for the Berachain testnet as well. As developers, community members, solo-stakers, and new-thing enjoyooors, we are excited about the new products and opportunities that Eigenlayer unlocks, and are looking forward to being a part of securing many of them!",
