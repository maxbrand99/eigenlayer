	"description": "0xak & Maxbrand99 run nodes for multiple products. We are one of 10 validators for Ronin, maintaining 99.99% uptime and a delegated stake of over $33MM+. We have maintained both the chain & bridge for Ronin for over ~11 months, securing the chain's $230MM+ TVL & $1B+ in natively issued tokens. We also were invited to and currently do run a node for the Berachain testnet. As devs, community members, and solo-stakers, we are excited about the new products and opportunities that Eigenlayer unlocks!",
